gee_anova <- function(model1){
  #model1 is the "full model" we are starting with. output object from geeglm (or other object that anova() will work on)
  #note that terms are added sequentially if we use the anova() function.
  #We want a p-value for each term *assuming all the others are included in the model*
  #so we can do that with anova() by placing
  #each term as the last term and applying anova() each time, keeping only the
  #pvalue for the "last term". Then for model selection we
  #remove the term which has the highest p-value.
  #this can be done manually (time-consuming), or using the following automated code
  #note: the code below will not work if the names of the predictor variables are "nested"
  #for example if one predictor is called "x" and the others are "x2" and "x3".
  #make sure names are unique, for example even "x1", "x2", "x3" would be ok!
